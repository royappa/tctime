TcTime provides these features related to Topcoder.com algorithm programming contests:
  <ul>
    <li>Given the points awarded for solving a problem, show how much time the coder took to solve it.</li>
    <li>Given the time taken to submit a problem, show how many points it will score.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The calculated information assumes that the problem's <i>first</i> submission is correct. Resubmitted problems incur penalties, which are not calculated here.
