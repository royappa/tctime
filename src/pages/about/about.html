TcTime provides these features related to Topcoder algorithm programming contests:
  <ul>
    <li>Given the points scored on a problem, find out how much time it took.</li>
    <li>Given the time scored on a problem, find out how many points it will score.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The app only counts the first submission. If you resubmit a problem, a penalty is applied and that is not simulated here.

  This link to Quora.com has both the scoring formula and a nice discussion:
